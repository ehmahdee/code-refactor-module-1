## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Module 1 Code Refactor

## Description
This is a website for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. The website describes their core business solutions and has a fully navigational header bar.

## Badges
N/A

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.


## Roadmap
Future release: Add media-queries to the css elements so the site automatically reformats for different screen sizes.

## Authors and acknowledgment
